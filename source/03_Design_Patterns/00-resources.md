[TL;DR](./assets/tl_dr_design_patterns.png)



## What is a design pattern?

Design patterns are `best practise strategies` to solve a `recurring problem`.

Whenever a problem arises, there are two options.

![Design Patters](https://jokestir.github.io/assets/tl_dr_design_patterns.png)

* If the problem is specific, invent a solution
* If the problem is generic and repeating, use design patterns

Questions to be asked when studying a design pattern

1. What is the common recurring problem?
2. What are the best strategies to solve them? (aka design)
3. Sample code
4. Real time use

## Types of design patterns

There are 3 types of design patterns (CSB)

#### 1. Creational design patterns

Creational design patterns focus on controlling the object creation process

e.g: Constructor, Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Builder

#### 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on realizing relationships between different objects.

e.g: Decorator, facade, Flyweight, Adapter, Proxy

#### 3. Behavioral design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on improving or streamlining communication between objects

e.g: Iterator, Mediator, Observer and mediator.
